# Nit-Atom
Nit language support for Atom text editor including Autocomplete feature, Snippets, and Syntax Highlighter.

## What is Nit?

According to its official website, Nit is an expressive programming language with a script-like syntax, a friendly type-system and aims at elegance, simplicity and intuitiveness.

## What is Atom?
Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js. It is written in CoffeeScript and Less. Atom was released from beta, as of version 1.0, on 25 June 2015. Its developers call it a "hackable text editor for the 21st Century".

## Autocomplete, Snippet, and Syntax Highlighter
Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the down arrow key to accept one of several.
Snippet is a programming term for a small region of the re-usable source code, machine code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. It allows the user to avoid repetitive typing in the course of routine edit operations.
Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms.

## Atom-Nit Package
Every programming language has rooms for improvement and Nit does not take exception in this rule. This package provides some essential features including autocomplete, snippet, syntax highlighting for Atom text editor, and helps Nit programmers to save their time.
We have made a demo version of this package available in this link. We did not upload this package to the Atom.io packages, due to the fact that our package needs some editions to be made and of course, after future modifications, it will be uploaded to the Atom.io packages repository for people use.
Local Package Installation
It is a very simple process, just install Atom text editor,  then download the package from GitHub, extract the package to a directory. In order to install the package on Atom, run CMD in the directory with the following command:
apm link
This command links the Nit-Atom package directory to the Atomâ€™s package directory and installs it.
